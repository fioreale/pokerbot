You will find three poker game instances (Leduc_A,  Leduc_B, Leduc_C) in the DropBox link
(https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9lfagrvfd39x8lx/AAAqjMmDNPt2QUsBVedQ-si9a?dl=0) by this evening. We will send you an email
as soon as we have uploaded them. Furthermore, we decided to postpone the deadline to submit your work (strategies and
slides describing your work) to July 15th.

You are asked for the following.



1. Leduc_A: this game is solvable even without abstractions. You are required to solve the game when abstractions are
used only for player 1. In particular, consider 4 levels of abstractions, in which the number of information sets of
player 1 are reduced by 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50%, respectively. To avoid any doubt: the size of the abstraction is
therefore 0.95 X, 0.90 X, 0.75 X, 0.50 X, where X is the number of information sets of player 1 in the original,
non-abstracted, game. Compare the average performance of the strategy for player 1 returned by your algorithm for
every level of abstraction with the performance of the optimal strategy (computed without any abstractions).
Provide us the following:

* the strategy of both players when no abstractions are used;

* the strategy of player 1 in the abstract game for the 4 levels of abstractions (without the application of subgame
solving procedure);

* the strategy of player 1 for the 4 levels of abstractions when subgame solving procedure is applied.



2. Leduc_B: this is a large Leduc game. You are required to apply your algorithm when the number of information sets of
each player is not larger than the number of information sets of the original, non-abstracted, Leduc_A. If necessary,
feel free to use an abstraction in which the number of information sets is smaller. Provide us the following:

* the strategy of both players in the abstract game (without the application of subgame solving procedure);

* the strategy of both players when subgame solving procedure is applied.



3. Leduc_C: this is a large Leduc game. You are required to apply your algorithm when the number of information sets of
each player is not larger than the number of information sets of the original, non-abstracted, Leduc_A. If necessary,
feel free to use an abstraction in which the number of information sets is smaller. Provide us the following:

* the strategy of both players in the abstract game (without the application of subgame solving procedure);

* the strategy of both players when subgame solving procedure is applied.
